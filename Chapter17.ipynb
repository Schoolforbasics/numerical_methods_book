In order to solve this problem we would chose a *discretization* (element shape/size), the number of degrees of freedom, distribution of degrees of freedom over the element and the shape function matrix. These choices have a great influence on efficieny of calculation and accuracy of the results. We could then minimize $\\Pi$ by taking the derivative w.r.t. our chosen degrees of freedom and proceed with the solution process in the same general procedure as our simpler examples. This is essentially the basics of the finite element method."
