      "The Rayleigh-Ritz method is based on an elegant branch of mathematics, the calculus of variations. In this method we solve a boundary-value problem by approximating the solution with a finite linear combination of simple basis functions that are chosen to fulfill certain criterion, including meeting the boundary conditions.\n",
