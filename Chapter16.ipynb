      "## Boundary Value Problems\n",
      "\n",
      "In all differential equations of order greater than 1, two or more values must be known to evaluate the constants in the particular function that satisfies the differential equation. In the problems discussed previously, these several values were all specified at the same value of the independent variable, generally at the start of the *initial value*. For that reason, these problems are called *initial value problems*.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an important class of problems, the several values of the function or its derivatives are not all known at the same point, but rather at two different values of the independent variable. Because these values of the independent variable are usually the endpoints (or *boundaries*) of the domain of interest, problems of this type are usually termed *boundary value problems*. Examples of these types of problems are: determining the deflections of a simply supported beam where the deflections and slopes are given at the supports and heat-flow problems where the temperatures and gradients may be given at two different points."
