      "## Partial Differential Equations\n",

      "Many physical phenomena are a function of more than one independent variable and must be represented by partial-differential equations (PDE's). Most scientific problems have mathematical models that are second-order equations, with the highest order of derivative being the second. If $u$ is a function of the two independent variables $x$ and $y$, there are three second-order partial derivatives:\n",

      "$$\n",
      "\n",
      "In general an equation involving these partial derivatives might have the form:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\n",

      "$$\n",

      "It is very important to understand the characteristic of the PDE because this will influence our solution technique. Notice that if the coefficients are functions of either independent variable, it's possible for the characteristic of the PDE's to change throughout the domain or during the solution time. We will begin our discussion of solution techniques with a very common hyperbolic PDE."
