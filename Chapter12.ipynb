      "Notice that for both $n=2$ and $n=3$ the error terms are $O(h^5)$. This means that the error of integration using a quadratic is similar to the integral using a cubic. Also notice that the quadratic's coefficient $(-\\frac{1}{90})$ is smaller than the coefficient for the cubic $(-\\frac{3}{80})$. The formula based on the quadratic is unexpectedly accurate. This phenomenon is true of all the even-order Newton-Cotes formulas; each has an order of $h$ in its error termt hat is the same as the formula for the next heighest order. This suggests that the even-order rules are especially useful."

      "The Newton-Cotes formulas for numerical integration were all developed on evenly spaced $x$-values, this means that the $x$ values were predetermined, possible as a result of experimental data acquisition or by eveluating an explicity known function at equal intervals.

A formula with three parameters corresponds to a polynomial of the second degree, one less than the number of parameters. Gauss oberserved that if we remove the requirement that the function be evaluated at predetermined $x$-values, a three term formula will contain six parameters (the $x$-values are now unknowns, plus the three weights) and should correspond to an interpolation polynomial of degree 5. Formulas based ont his principle are called *Gaussian quadrature formulas*. They can be applied only when $f(x)$ is explicitly known, so that it can be evaluated at any desired value of $x$.\n",
